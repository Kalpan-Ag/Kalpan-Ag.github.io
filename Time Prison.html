							<b>Roles:</b> 2D Developer, Gameplay Programmer | Team Size: 4<br>
							<b>Elevator Pitch:</b> 
							Time Prison is a 2D mystical platformer game where the player tries to escape from a deceptive labyrinth with twisted physics controlled by an enemy AI. 
							The player will fail multiple times and learn from each attempt to ultimately escape the labyrinth.
							<br>
							<b>Summary of Core Gameplay:</b> 
							The gameplay of Time Prison revolves around the player trying to escape a deceptive labyrinth with twisted physics controlled by an enemy AI. The player will need to learn from each attempt and use that knowledge to progress further in the game. 
							The game is designed to deceive the player with obstacles that look common but act uniquely, increasing the difficulty level as the player progresses.

									<h3>Gameplay and Level Design</h3>
									<p>
										The gameplay of Time Prison is based on trial and error, where the player needs to fail multiple times to understand the twisted physics and escape the labyrinth. 
										The game has three checkpoints, and the obstacles have been designed to deceive the player based on their prior knowledge of 2D platformers. 
										The obstacles are placed in such a way that the difficulty level increases as the player progresses, and they are challenged throughout the course of the game.
										<p><span class="image right"><img src="images/Time Prison/Concept Art.png" alt="" /></span>
											The level design of Time Prison is made in a way to teach the players something they can use in the next try. The obstacles have been designed to surprise and possibly frustrate the player. 
											Each obstacle is designed in such a way that the player is deceived by looking at the obstacle, even though they have surpassed a few obstacles. 
											The obstacles have been placed in a way that the player's knowledge of the previous obstacle is taken into consideration, and they are deceived based on that knowledge. 
											The level design is meant to increase the difficulty level as the player progresses and provide a challenging experience.

								<p><b>Project Goal:</b>
									The goal of Time Prison is to create a 2D mystical platformer game with deceptive physics and challenging obstacles. 
									The game is designed to provide a fun and engaging experience to the players and increase the difficulty level as the player progresses.
									<br><h5>My Roles and Responsibilities:</h5>
										<ul>
											<li>I was responsible for designing the core gameplay mechanics, creating the game's concept and storyline, and overseeing the project's development.</li>
											<li>Designed the game's levels, including the placement of obstacles and the overall difficulty level.</li>
											<li>Implemented the gameplay mechanics, controls and other design elements.</li>
										</ul>
									<h5>Tools and Technologies:</h5>
									<ul>
										<li>Game Engine: Unity</li>
										<li>Programming Languages: C#</li>
										<li>PC Hardware: Windows PC</li>
										<li>Design Tools: Adobe Creative Cloud, Davinci</li>
										<li>Project Management: Trello, Miro, GitHub</li>
									</ul>
									<h5>Challenges and Solutions:</h5>
									<ul>
										<li>One of the biggest challenges in designing Time Prison was creating obstacles that were challenging and deceptive without being too frustrating for the players. 
											To overcome this challenge, we playtested the game extensively and made adjustments to the obstacles' design and placement based on player feedback.
										</li>
										<li>Another challenge was creating the game's twisted physics that would be deceptive but still intuitive enough for the player to understand. 
											To overcome this challenge, we created a set of rules for the physics and tested them to ensure that they were both fun and challenging.
										</li>
									</ul>

									</ul>
									Time Prison was a challenging and exciting project to work on. We were able to create a 2D platformer game with a unique twist that provided a fun and engaging experience for the players. 
									The game's obstacles and twisted physics created a challenging but rewarding experience that required the players to learn from their mistakes and use that knowledge to progress further in the game. 
									Overall, we are proud of the final product and believe it is a great addition to our portfolio.
