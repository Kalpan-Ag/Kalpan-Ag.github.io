									<h3>Gameplay and Level Design</h3>
									<p><span class="image right"><img src="images/NuclearNightmare/Sketches.png"  alt="" /><br><img src="images/NuclearNightmare/Bunkers.png" alt="" /></span>
										The gameplay in Nuclear Nightmare revolves around exploration and survival. As players navigate through the wasteland, they must constantly be on the lookout for shelter from the deadly acid rain that falls from the sky. 
										The level design is intricate and detailed, featuring a variety of buildings, objects, and obstacles for players to interact with. 
										The use of environmental storytelling helps to create a rich and immersive world that draws players in and keeps them engaged. The game features a mix of both indoor and outdoor environments, 
										each with their own unique challenges and hazards. The outdoor areas are vast and open, allowing players to explore and discover new areas of the wasteland. 
										The indoor areas are more claustrophobic and confined, forcing players to navigate through tight corridors and rooms filled with debris and obstacles.
										<p>
											In addition to the level design, the gameplay in Nuclear Nightmare also features a unique health system. Players must constantly monitor their exposure to radiation and seek out medical supplies to maintain their health. This adds an extra layer of tension and strategy to the game, as players must balance their exploration and survival needs in order to succeed.
