								<b>Roles:</b> VR and 3D Developer, Level Design, Environment Design | Team Size: 4<br>
								<b>Elevator Pitch:</b> VR Two-gether is a cooperative puzzle game where one player uses VR while the other uses PC, collaborating to solve challenges and progress through two levels featuring asymmetric mechanics and a balanced give-and-take dynamic.<br>
								<b>Summary of Core Gameplay:</b> Two players, one in VR and one on PC, must collaborate to progress through cooperative puzzles across two levels. Each level introduces asymmetric mechanics, with the first focused on movement and traversal and the second on shooting and shielding.

									<h3>Gameplay and Level Design</h3>

								<p></p>

									The game consists of two levels, each with tutorials for both players at the beginning and cooperative puzzle challenges throughout. These levels are designed based on a spectrum of different cooperative dynamics and different affordances for the VR and PC.
									
									In the first level, players are introduced to core mechanics of movement and traversal, including asymmetric mechanics of parkour abilities for the PC player and teleportation for the VR player. Players have a chance to learn the controls and new mechanics in a short tutorial, then need to work together to overcome cooperative puzzle challenges.
									
								<p><span class="image right"><img src="images/VR2gether/Level 1 Route.jpg" width="400" height="400" alt="" /></span>									In the second level, asymmetric mechanics of shooting for the VR player and shield for the PC player are introduced. Similar to level one, players first have time to practice the mechanics at their own pace and then play together in cooperative challenges.
									
									The game aims to encourage cooperation between the two players by designing challenges based on cooperative dynamics that create meaningful cooperation presented by Ptrick Redding in his GDC talk with the same topic. The PC player, a treasure hunter, is searching for treasure in ancient hidden cities while he/she meets the VR player, a time traveler. The two players have different skills to learn from each other, with the VR player having technology and futuristic knowledge, and the PC player having mythical knowledge of the ancient world. The two players have a mutual give-and-take relation and balanced abilities as the game progresses.</p>
